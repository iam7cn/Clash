									<p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone.</p>

What's the matter with this thing, what's all that churnning and bubbling, you call that radar screen? Ah, planet Druidia. And under that air shield, ten thousand years of fresh air. We must get through that air shield! Say goodbye to your two best friends, and I don't mean your pals in the Winnebago.

Oh dear...The odds of successfully surviving an attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer are approximately... Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Oh. They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to lightspeed. Stupid little short-circuit! He'll be *quite* all right. </p>

									<p>Can we talk? OK, we all know Prince Valium is a pill. But you could have married him for your father's sake and had a headache for the next 25 years. Well, goodbye virgin alarm. Besides he got a sexy voice. He might be cute. Hey wait, you forgot to get married! And if we go over our pagecount, the network will kill us. You know, you've got a very unique voice. You should be in silent films.</p>
